NetBeans Plugin for PlatformIO
==============================

NBPIO is a plugin suite for Netbeans 8.1 that provides easy integration of PlatformIO within the IDE. It consists of three plugins:

+ PlatformIO Project
+ SerialMonitor
+ PureJavaComm
 
The first provides a special project wizard for PlatformIO projects, the second provides a Serial Monitor while the third is just a wrapper around a PureJavaComm library (an RXTX replacement)
